[_**Zeppidy, Inc.**_](http://www.zeppidy.com) - The Home Buying & Selling Platformâ„¢ is a Portland, Oregon tech startup streamlining the real estate process for buyers, sellers, and agents.

Over a five week internship with Zeppidy I had the opportunity to build a number of front-end and back-end microservices used by the production site. Zeppidy contracted a foreign team of developers to create an initial Drupal 7 based site which had several limitations, including poor scalability and dated user interface. Working directly under the CEO and CTO, I was tasked with building front-end web components with Polymer and back-end REST API's using Loopback which replaced features of the Drupal website. This resulted in a faster, scalable, and all around better UX and improved interface with a complex database structure.

The main project I worked on was a _*Market Trends*_ viewer that allows users to explore a wide range of market statistics related to any listed property. Users can explore a number of charts, graphics, and maps related to market statistics, and can quickly and easily filter information by area (city, zip, or neighborhood) and time intervals (monthly, quarterly, yearly). The front-end was built using Polymer as well as the Google Maps API and Google Charts API. The back-end was built using Loopback and ReactiveJS. The back-end REST API provided all the information needed for the front-end by making a series of calls to both Zeppidy's databases and outside services. I had the honor to include the _*Market Trends*_ in the launch of the site.
> Note:
> To view a live version of the Market Trends component, simply navigate to the page for any currently listed property on [Zeppidy](http://www.zeppidy.com) and tap/click the Market Trends drawer on the bottom of the page.**

I also had the opportunity to assisted other interns in the development of components including a typeahead predictive search bar, a photo masonry and carousel lightbox, and a wrapper component that will eventually replace the entire property listing page.

In addition to working on Zeppidy's software, I got to practice a range of other professional skills including...
  - demoing software to clients.
  - deploying projects by managing the development server.
  - identifying and fixing bugs in the code base based on user feedback.
  - coordinating with a diverse team on a large project.
