            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm an energetic and collaborative junior full stack web developer with a passion for learning and applying new skills and technologies. I'm proficient in both javascript and php with experience independently producing functional, professional, and documented software on a tight time-line.</p>
            <p>I previously worked in environmental management as a river restoration consult and field botantist, but I didn't feel like it was the correct career path for me. So at the end of 2015 I began to teach myself how to build websites and enrolled in Epicodus, a vocational school for aspiring programmers. Over 6 months of intensive courses, I learned a wide range of web development technologies and tools. At the end of the program, I completed a 5 week internship during which I built both front- and back-end services, including a 'market trends' web component that allows users to interactively explore real estate market statistics through various charts and graphs.</p>
